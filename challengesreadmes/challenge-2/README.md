## Approach & Efficiency

First for loop was used to add first half of values; add the valuse manually;
use the second for loop for second half to complete new array.

Technically it is O(2n) but from research constant is dropped and is O(n)

I think the space complexity is O(n) since a new array is added with 1 more value in linear manner.
