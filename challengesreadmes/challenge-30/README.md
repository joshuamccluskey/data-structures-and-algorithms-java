# Hash Table


Create a hash table and create methods set(); get(); contains(); keys(); hash()

- set() - this is a robust method that will hash and set the key and set the value pair and handle collisions

- get() - returns the vaule of a key

- contains() -  returns boolean if Hask Table conatains a key

- keys() -  returns a collection of keys

- hash()- returns the index of that key

## Approach & Efficiency

Took the recursive approach to preorder traverse and added the condtionals
for to add odd numbers

Big O notation: Time Complexity O(n) and Auxiliary Space complexity O(1), but later discussed why it owuld be
O (n) in the space complexity of the recursive approach.
